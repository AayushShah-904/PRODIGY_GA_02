Stable Diffusion is a method for creating images from text descriptions using AI. 

1. **Start with Noise**: It begins with a random, noisy image.
2. **Step-by-Step Denoising**: The model gradually reduces the noise, refining the image in each step, based on the text description.
3. **Final Image**: After several steps, the noise is removed, and the image matches the text prompt.

It's like sculpting a statue from a block of marble, starting rough and gradually refining the details until it looks like the desired image.
